## About Babbo Motel
Babbo Hotel is a social game where users can customise their own sprites and socialise with other users in the 2D Pixel World. The intial idea was inspired by Habbo Hotel and Gather, both social platforms that are "gamified", hence the name Babbo Motel (motel because the project is of much smaller scale ðŸ˜†). 

Babbo Hotel came from a personal curiousity to understand & explore how a game would run on a browser. The idea was also largely inspired by the rise of web3 and gamefi with the integration of NFT for in-game item however but due to the time constraint, the idea had to be put aside for future development.
