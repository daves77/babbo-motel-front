# Post Moterm for Babbo Motel
---

##### What went well?
- Managed to get multiplayer working 
- Creation & customisation of individual sprites
- Increased understanding of JS classes

##### What were the biggest challenges you faced? 
- Initial lack of understanding of HTML canvas
- Understanding the game loop and how the game updates (by using requestAnimationFrame)
- Ensuring that the sprites do not go out of their boundaries. (out of their grid)
- Integrating multiplayer and ensuring that sprites animate when users move about
- Was using too many event listners at one point to communicate between the canvas and React
- Players would suddenly clip out of their grid (this would break the game logic that stops players from running into objects)

##### What would you do differently next time?
- Will probably use Pixi.js in the future if I were to build a game from scratch again
